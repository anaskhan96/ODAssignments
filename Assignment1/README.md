## Inventory Management

* Compilation - `cd src` then `javac InventoryManagement.java`
* Execution - `java InventoryManagement -name <itemName> -price <itemPrice> -quantity <itemQuantity> -type <raw, manufactured, or imported>`

After adding the first item (from command line arguments), it displays a prompt `Do you want to enter details of any other item (y/n)?: `, and provides an interface to store more items as long as the user answers `y`.
